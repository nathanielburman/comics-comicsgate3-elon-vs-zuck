Title: Elon Musk Versus Mark Zuckerburg. Good Versus Evil. Republican Versus Democrat.

In this universe, this New Universe, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerburg challenged each other to a duel. Both are men. Both men are trained in Martial Arts. Both men should put their training to use. In a fair fight that will be talked about and studied for generations.

Fair fights can and do happen if proper rules are set in place. UFC knows how to host fair fights. But can their glam go along with the sharpness of the tongue? These men will verbally assault each other and teach us all an important lesson in fair fighting with communication integrated into each round.

Each round is over after an opponent lands an attack. An attack can come from the verbal attacker or the defender. Verbal attacks can empower the opponents in multiple ways. If a verbal attack is true, then this can lead to verbal structures being created which could be more dangerous than a punch or kick to the guts.

#Fear #Versus #Dread

Rules of the Fight:
Points awarded per attack.
Rounds have no time limit.
Verbal Attacks energize the opponents.
Round #1 Starts in Iron-Man armor.
Round X2 Starts in Light armor, leathers.
Round X3 Starts in Covered Fists.
Round X4 Starts in Full Contact.

Count Points. Award Awards.

Special Rules:
Tag-Team of two women per side, who can be called into the fight in any round. Women would love to get in on all the fun.

You can have multiple rounds in Iron-Man armor, etc. and have multiple rounds in Covered Fists rounds, etc.

But wait, what will the ultimate prize be? Glory? I don't think so. They will be fighting for the prize of a Moon. One moon in this solar system will be awarded to the winner. Figuring out how to get the moon into our orbit is the real prize here folks.

The price of a moon, 6 trillion dollars.
